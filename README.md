# Smart Attendance System using Raspberry Pi in python

 This project is implemented in Raspberry Pi 4 Model B . It uses Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to detect a person's face using USB camera / Pi-Camera and checks whether the person is present or absent for the day.If the person is present, it shows at what time he/she was present in the local database.The local database stores the daily log of all people that the camera has detected .We can later access any date that we want and know about a person's attendance.


Another Folder called "data" needs to be copied into your current Repository . As GitHub allows only 25 MB of uploads from the system , use the below drive link to download it.



Note: MAKE SURE THAT THE ENTIRE "data" FOLDER ITSELF IS PRESENT IN YOUR LOCAL REPOSITORY . DON'T JUST DOWNLOAD THE FOLDERS PRESENT INSIDE OF THE "data" FOLDER i.e., DON'T DOWNLOAD "data_dlib" and "data_faces_from_camera" SEPARATELY . EVEN IF YOU DO IT , MAKE SURE TO PUT THEM INSIDE A PARENT FOLDER CALLED "data" OR ELSE YOUR CODE WILL THROW ERRORS.
