# Smart Attendance System using Raspberry Pi in python
 This project is implemented in Raspberry Pi 4 Model B . It uses Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to detect a person's face using USB camera / Pi-Camera and checks whether the person is present or absent for the day.If the person is present, it shows at what time he/she was present in the local database.The local database stores the daily log of all people that the camera has detected .We can later access any date that we want and know about a person's attendance.
